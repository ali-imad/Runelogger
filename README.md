# Runelogger

## Description

This project is be a simple tool used to track boss kills in Old School RuneScape. 
The boss kill log will track time to kill the boss, total kill count, and loot gained from the boss kills.

Developed as a means of seeing how creatively I could style something with the restraint of only using Java and Swing

## Features
 - As a user, I should be able to add boss kills to the boss log, storing the value of a kill and the time to kill
 - As a user, I should be able to view specific bosses and find average time to kill and loot value
 - As a user, I should be able to view the five most recent kills I have logged
 - As a user, I should be able to remove old kill entries
 - As a user, I should have an empty boss log when I open the application
 - As a user, I should be able to save the state of the logger, serializing every kill entry
 - As a user, I should be able to load the state of the logger, reading in a session file that contains a serialized log
 - As a user, I should be able to add bosses outside the three default options.
